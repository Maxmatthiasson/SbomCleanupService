# üßπ SbomCleanupService

**SbomCleanupService** is a background worker built with .NET 8 that automates the archival of outdated Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) data. It connects to a PostgreSQL database, evaluates SBOM entries against Azure DevOps pipelines, and archives entries that are no longer associated with active builds.

## üöÄ Features

* Connects to a PostgreSQL database to fetch SBOM entries.
* Authenticates with Azure DevOps using a Personal Access Token (PAT).
* Checks if SBOM-related pipelines are still active.
* Automatically marks outdated SBOM records as archived.
* Runs on a daily schedule as a Windows Service.

## üìÅ Project Structure

* **`Worker.cs`**: Core background service that handles the cleanup logic.
* **`Program.cs`**: Entry point that sets up the worker as a Windows Service.

## üîß Prerequisites

* .NET 8 SDK
* PostgreSQL database
* Azure DevOps account with valid PAT
* Windows system (for running as a service)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables before running the service:

| Variable Name            | Description                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `SbomDbConnectionString` | PostgreSQL connection string to the SBOM table |
| `SbomCleanupPAT`         | Azure DevOps Personal Access Token             |

Alternatively set-up another way to store the connection string and PAT.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Running

### 1. Build the project

```bash
dotnet build
```

### 2. Set required environment variables

You can set these permanently in Windows or temporarily in a terminal:

```bash
$env:SbomDbConnectionString="Host=localhost;Username=sbom_user;Password=yourpassword;Database=sbom_db"
$env:SbomCleanupPAT="your_azure_devops_pat"
```

### 3. Run the worker manually

```bash
dotnet run
```

### 4. Install as a Windows Service

You can register the worker as a Windows Service using `sc.exe` or [PowerShell scripts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/windows-service#installing-a-windows-service).

Example using `sc.exe` (after publishing):

```bash
sc create SbomCleanupService binPath= "C:\path\to\SbomCleanupService.exe"
```

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema Example

Expected table format in PostgreSQL:

```sql
        CREATE TABLE sbom_table (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            sbom_data JSONB,
            collection VARCHAR(255),
            project VARCHAR(255),
            build_number VARCHAR(255),
            archived BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
            created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
            updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
            UNIQUE (collection, project)
        );
```

## üîÑ How It Works

1. Fetch all SBOM records where `archived = false`.
2. Query Azure DevOps to check if the associated build is active.
3. If the build is **not found**, the record is marked as `archived = true`.
4. Logs all actions and errors for auditing.

## üìù Logging

* Logs include timestamps and operation statuses.
* Uses `ILogger` for structured logging.
* Can be redirected to file/event log when run as a Windows Service.

## üìÖ Scheduling

The cleanup process runs on start and then **once every 24 hours** by default, using:

```csharp
await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromDays(1), stoppingToken);
```
